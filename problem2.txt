PROBLEM:

Consider a staircase of size n = 4 :

   #
  ##
 ###
####
Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.

Function Description

Complete the staircase function in the editor below. It should print a staircase as described above.

staircase has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer
Input Format

A single integer,n , denoting the size of the staircase.

Constraints

 . 0 < n < 100

Output Format

Print a staircase of size n  using # symbols and spaces.

Note: The last line must have  0 spaces in it.

Sample Input

6 
Sample Output

     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######
Explanation

The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of n = 6 .


SOLUTION:

package com.capgemini.practicejava.hackerrankprograms;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println("Enter the size of staircase");
		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = scan.nextInt();
		scan.close();


		for (int spaces = n - 1; spaces >= 0; spaces--) {
			for (int i = 0; i < spaces; i++) {
				System.out.print(" ");
			}
			for (int i = spaces; i < n; i++) {
				System.out.print("#");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}
