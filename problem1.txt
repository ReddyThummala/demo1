For this problem, we have  types of queries you can perform on a List:

Insert  at index :

Insert
x y
Delete the element at index :

Delete
x
Given a list, , of  integers, perform  queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the initial number of elements in ).
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing .
The third line contains an integer,  (the number of queries).
The  subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:

If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space separated integers , and the value  must be inserted into  at index .
If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index , whose element must be deleted from .
Constraints

Each element in is a 32-bit integer.
Output Format

Print the updated list  as a single line of space-separated integers.

Sample Input

5
12 0 1 78 12
2
Insert
5 23
Delete
0
Sample Output

0 1 78 12 23

SOLUTION:


package com.capgemini.practicejava.hackerrankprograms;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter no of elements in list");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		System.out.println("Enter elements");
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int m = sc.nextInt();
			a.add(m);
		}
		
		System.out.println("no.of operations to be done");
		int numOprtns = sc.nextInt();
		for (int i = 0; i < numOprtns; i++) {
			
			System.out.println("name of opertion to perform:");
			String str = sc.next();
			if(str.equals("insert")) {
				
				// for insertion
				int index = sc.nextInt();
				int value = sc.nextInt();
				
				a.add(index, value);
			} else {

				// for deletion
				int index1 = sc.nextInt(); 
				 
				a.remove(index1);
			}
		}

		// iterate using for each loop
		for (Integer integer : a) {
			System.out.print(integer + " ");
		}	
	}
}
